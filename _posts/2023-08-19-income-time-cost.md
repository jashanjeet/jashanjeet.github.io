Before we begin exploring this relationship, let me highlight some terms that are either real or exist in my own head:
**Non-discretionary expenses**: The living cost that you have to incur. Examples include: rent, food, debt, transportation to work.
**Non-discretionary time**: The time spent on activities that you cannot do anything about (at least right now). Examples include sleep time, work time, transportation time to work, time spent on personal hygiene.

Non-discretionary expenses, in combination with your income-per-hour, define your non-discretionary time to a large extent.

Lets look at the window where this matters the most:
 - A range of 100 to 3000 dollars per month for the non-discretionary living cost.
 - A range of 2 to 200 dollars per hour for the income.
 - 16 available hours in a day after subtracting the sleep and personal hygiene time.

Here's what the relationship looks like:
